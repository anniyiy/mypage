    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p id="About me">Hi! You already know that my name is Anna, but you can also call me Anny, Anuyta, Annia etc. :) I`m 21 years old. Now I`m currently stuck in Munich, Germany. However, basically I live in Moscow, Russia. I`m just at the beginning of the great life-journey, so I search for cool job experience, exciting trips, new places & ways to live, curious people to know and all the other unimaginable things. Via this page you can learn a bit more about me and find my contacts!</p>

    <h3>Career</h3>
     <p id="Career">Though I`m still a student, I`e already got some real job experience. I`m passionate about media, so it was essential for me to start working as soon as possible. I was a junior at RT TV channel and a group leader at a jornalistic laboratory at my university. Then I became a project manager at an advertising agency <a href="http://april-agency.com/" target="_blank">April</a>. There I had luck to make and moderate content for Instagram pages of worldwide brands: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/starbucksrussia/?hl=en" target="_blank">Starbucks</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/esteelauderrussia/?hl=en" target="_blank">Estee Lauder</a>. I had to quit April for the academy exchange, thus right now I`m actively looking for a new job opportunity. I desire to enhance my hard skills in media and try my best in creativity and making videos.</p>
